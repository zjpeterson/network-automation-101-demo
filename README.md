# network-automation-101-demo

The demo content I developed for the the _Network Automation 101_ Red Hat webinar on August 24, 2021. I'll put a link here to the recording when available.

The demo uses a ServiceNow credential type that doesn't come by default as part of Ansible Tower. I have a playbook available that can create this for you at: https://github.com/zjpeterson/ansible-tower-credential-types
